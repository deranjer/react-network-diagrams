/**
 * Endpoint drawing primative. This essentially renders the shape we use to represent
 * for an endpoint on the circuit diagrams. The result is a `<g>` element containing
 * the endpoint rendering, so this needs to be used within the context of an `<svg>` block, or
 * more likely, just use a `<Circuit>`.
 *
 * The `x` and `y` props determine the position of the endpoint on the svg grid, while
 * 'labelPosition' determines where the label for the endpoint will be positioned around
 * the endpoint. The `offset` property allow you to customize the distance the label has
 * from the endpoint's `x` and `y` as the initial position of the label is determined
 * based on these props. The `offset` property has no effect on the angled labels, as
 * these require pre-determined offset distances based on the rotation. The `label` prop
 * is the name that will be displayed on the endpoint.

     * ```
     * const endpointStyle = {
