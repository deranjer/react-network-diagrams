## Topology

At a high level our topology data looks like this:

```js
const topology = {
    "name": "My traffic map",
    "description": "This is an optional description",
    "nodes": [ ... ],
    "edges": [ ... ],
    "paths": [ ... ]
}
```

### Nodes

The nodes list in the topology contains a list of node objects. This object contains, at a minimum:
 * `type`
 * `name`
 * `x` and `y` - coordinates for the position of the node

Optionally the node can contain:
 * `label_position` - information about where to position the node label. Label position may be "top", "bottom", "left" or "right", or combinations such as "topleft"
 * `label_dx`, `label_dy` - offsets for fine adjustment of label positions
  
At ESnet our nodes also contain extra information about that node that are specific to our use case.

Example for the ALBQ hub:

```js
{
    "name": "ALBQ",
    "type": "hub",
    "label_dx": null,
    "label_dy": null,
    "label_position": "left",
    "x": 75.0,
    "y": 85.0
},
```

### Edges

The edges list in the topology contains a list of edge objects. An edge object connects two nodes, specified by the `source` and `target`. The capacity field is a string label can be used to style the link based on its capacity (see `edgeThicknessMap` below).

Like nodes we often pass extra information into the edge objects for our own use within the page, such as which interfaces are use in that connection.

Example edge, representing a connection from our ALBQ to DENV hubs:

```js
{
  "capacity": "100G",
  "source": "ALBQ",
  "target": "DENV",
  ...
},
```

### Paths

The paths list contains a list of path objects. A path object connects multiple nodes together to form a path across the topology. Each path contains:

 * `name` - name the path should be referred to by
 * `steps` - a list of Node names

Example path connecting NERSC, to Starlight, to ANL.

```js
{
  "name": "NorthPath",
  "steps": [
    "NERSC",
    "STARLIGHT",
    "ANL"
  ],
},
```

#### Notes about displaying paths

To display paths on the map you need to:
 1. Define one or more paths in the topology, as explained above
 2. Tell the maps code which paths to show using the `showPaths` prop on the `<TrafficMap>`
 3. Use an `edgeDrawingMethod` which is suited to rendering paths

Paths will be displayed on the map if the `showPaths` prop of the `<TrafficMap>` is provided. This prop can either be:
 * a boolean (and if true the map will show all paths), or
 * an array of path names to show.

Paths can be displayed when one of two styles are specified in the `edgeDrawingMethod`:
 * "simple" will display the schematic rendering of the path, i.e. a simple line drawn through the nodes, or
 * "pathBidirectionalArrow", which will show traffic arrows for just the paths being rendered (and not other links in the map).

## Traffic

The map is able to render itself as a heat map based on current traffic levels.

### Edge traffic

To specify those levels we provide a [Pond Event](http://esnet-pondjs.appspot.com/#/event) containing the current traffic rates (using the edge name ($sourceNode--$destNode) in each direction) at a given timestamp. This event may be part of a [Pond Event](http://esnet-pondjs.appspot.com/#/timeseries) or it could be a stand alone Event with the current traffic levels.

The simplest way to construct this traffic event would look like this:

```js
import { TimeEvent } from "pondjs";
import * as Immutable from "immutable";
const timestamp = 1431649302000;
const traffic = new TimeEvent(timestamp, Immutable.Map({
    ALBQ--DENV: 126513360.8
    DENV--ALBQ: 323736723.4
    ...
}));
```

The rendering of the edges uses the `edgeColorMap` to map from value ranges (bps) to a color. See below.

### Path traffic

Rendering path traffic is similar to that for the edge traffic. We use a convention for the names to designate the direction of the traffic along the path: $pathname--AtoZ or $pathname--ZtoA. Here is an example:

```js
import { TimeEvent } from "pondjs";
import * as Immutable from "immutable";
const timestamp = 1431649302000;
const pathTraffic = new TimeEvent(timestamp, Immutable.Map({
    "northPath--AtoZ": 20000000000,
    "northPath--ZtoA": 3000000000,
    "southPath--AtoZ": 40000000000,
    "southPath--ZtoA": 5000000000
}));
```

Like the edge traffic, the path traffic levels are mapped to colors with the `edgeColorMap`. See below.

## Styling

The TrafficMap code is configured with a set of maps which give styling information to the map rendering code.

### style

This controls the top level container that contains the map. You can pass inline CSS as this prop to change the
background color or border styling of the map.

Example:

```js
const style={{
    borderRadius: 10,
    background: "#f9f9f9",
    borderStyle: "solid",
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderColor: "#CCC"
}}
```

### nodeSizeMap

A mapping from the `type` field in the node object to a size to draw the shape

Example:

```js
const nodeSizeMap = {
    hub: 5.5,
    esnet_site: 7
};
```

### edgeThicknessMap

A mapping of the `capacity` field within the tologogy edge object to a line thickness for rendering the edges.

Example:

```js
const edgeThicknessMap = {
    "100G": 5,
    "10G": 3,
    "1G": 1.5,
    subG: 1
};
```

### edgeShapeMap

A mapping of the edge name (which is source + "--" + target) to a dict of edge shape options:

 - `shape` (either "linear" or "curved")
 - `direction` (if shape is curved, either "left" or "right")
 - `offset` (if shape is curved, the amount of curve, which is pixel offset from a straight line between the source and target at the midpoint)

Example:

```js
const edgeShapeMap = {
    "ALBQ--DENV": {
    "shape": "curved",
    "direction": "right",
    "offset": 15
}
```

### nodeShapeMap

Mapping of node `name` to shape (default is `circle`, other options are `cloud` or `square` currently).

Example:

```js
const nodeShapeMap = {
    DENV: "square"
};
```

### Node styles

In addition to the above styling you can specify CSS properties for different node types:

```js
const stylesMap = {
    "hub": hubStyle,
    "esnet_site": siteStyle
};
```

Each style (e.g. hubStyle above) specifies properties for its label and the node itself, for each of three states: `normal`, `selected` and `muted`. For example:

```js
const hubStyle = {
    node: {
        normal: {fill: "#CBCBCB",stroke: "#BEBEBE", cursor: "pointer"},
        selected: {fill: "#37B6D3", stroke: "rgba(55, 182, 211, 0.22)",
                   strokeWidth: 10, cursor: "pointer"},
        muted: {fill: "#CBCBCB", stroke: "#BEBEBE", opacity: 0.6,
                cursor: "pointer"}
    },
    label: {
        normal: {fill: "#696969", stroke: "none", fontSize: 9},
        selected: {fill: "#333",stroke: "none", fontSize: 11},
        muted: {fill: "#696969", stroke: "none", fontSize: 8,
        opacity: 0.6}
    }
};
```

Note that muted will be applied to nodes which are not selected.

### Path styles

You can use styling maps to specify the color and width of paths:

```js
const pathColorMap = {
    northPath: "#ff7f0e",
    southPath: "#aec7e8",
};

const pathWidthMap = {
    northPath: 4,
    southPath: 2,
};
```

### edgeColorMap

The edge color map maps an edge rate (bits per second, specified in the traffic event) to a color using the "range" and "color" values. In this example, traffic across a link between 50 and 100 Gbps (`range: [50, 100]`)would be mapped to red (`color: #990000`).

The "label" isn't needed for this mapping, but the traffic `<MapLegend>` component will accept this same structure and use the label for its display.

```js
const edgeColorMap = [
    {color: "#990000", label: ">=50 Gbps", range: [50, 100]},
    {color: "#bd0026", label: "20 - 50", range: [20, 50]},
    {color: "#cc4c02", label: "10 - 20", range: [10, 20]},
    {color: "#016c59", label: "5 - 10", range: [5, 10]},
    {color: "#238b45", label: "2 - 5", range: [2, 5]},
    {color: "#3690c0", label: "1 - 2", range: [1, 2]},
    {color: "#74a9cf", label: "0 - 1", range: [0, 1]}
];
```

## Putting it all together

Finally we can render the traffic map itself:

```js
import { TrafficMap } from "react-network-diagrams";

...

    render() {
        return (
            ...
            <TrafficMap
                bounds={{x1: -5, y1: 5, x2: 240, y2: 120}}
                topology={topology}
                style={{
                    background: "#ffffff"
                }}
                traffic={traffic}
                edgeColorMap={edgeColorMap}
                edgeDrawingMethod="bidirectionalArrow"
                edgeThicknessMap={edgeThicknessMap}
                edgeShapeMap={edgeShapeMap}
                nodeSizeMap={nodeSizeMap}
                nodeShapeMap={nodeShapeMap}
                stylesMap={stylesMap}
                selection={selection}
                onSelectionChange={this.handleSelectionChanged} />
            ...
        );
    }
```
